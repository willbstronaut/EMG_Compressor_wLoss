The algorithm is tested on EMG data from the paper "Algorithm For Compression of EMG Signals", by P. A. Berger, A. O. Nascimento, J. C. Carmo, A. F. Rocha and I. dos Santos. The developed algorithm achieves a high compression rate, maintaining the fidelity of the original signal compared to the reconstructed signal. Using vector quantization, the algorithm achieved an even higher compression performance, but since there are losses in this case, the reconstructed signal approached the original signal, but with a small variation.
